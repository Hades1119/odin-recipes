    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        a dish of meat, usually brisket of beef or chuck roast, 
        stewed in one piece in a covered pot and served in its own gravy.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 lb chuck roast</li>
        <li>salt, black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>2 cup beef broth</li>
        <li>2 lb small yellow potatoes</li>
        <li>1 lb carrots</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by seasoning the beef well, on all sides with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>In a dutch oven or heavy pot, heat oil. Brown roast on all sides to lock in moisture and flavor (about 15-min). Transfer to a plate.</li>
        <li>To the grease left in the pot, add in onions and garlic and saute until onions are translucent (about 2-3 minutes). Then stir in the tomato paste, then flour. At this point the flour will absorb all the oil/ moisture. Add the wine, stir and allow the wine to reduce (1-2 minutes). Add beef broth, a few sprigs of fresh thyme and bay leaves.</li>
        <li>Transfer the beef back to the pot. Add carrots and potatoes around the beef in the pot. Cover and cook in the oven at 350F degrees for 2 Â½ to 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Garnish with parsley</li>
        <li>When done, garnish with fresh parsley or cilantro and serve</li>
    </ol>
